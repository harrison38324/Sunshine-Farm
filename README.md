# Project : large fish eat small fish

## Made by Harrison 

*Q&A*

- What will the application do?
    players should **control the player's fish** and eat smaller fish to become bigger and avoid being eaten by the larger fish.
    If the player's fish touch the smaller fish, the smaller fish will be eaten and the player's fish will grow up.
    If the player's fish touch the larger fish, game ends.
- Who will use it?
    the players should use it to play.
- Why is this project of interest to me?
    It is a very traditional game and I played it since I was very young and I may want to add more function and make the game more interesting. But at this stage, I will only describe the basic functionality.
